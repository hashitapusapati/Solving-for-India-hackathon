## How it works?
# Fake Product Identification using Blockchain

## Packages Required:-
- Truffle v5.6.7 (core: 5.6.7)
- Ganache v7.5.0
- Solidity v0.5.16 (solc-js)
- Node v15.8.0
- Web3.js v1.7.4
- npm 7.5.1

## Other Requirements:-
1. Any chromium based browser i.e. Chrome 
2. Metamask browser extension
    
## setup process 

```
1. Go to the project folder, open terminal there and run following command to install required node_modules:-
```
npm install
```
2. Compile contract source files. (Compilation and deployment can be done using truffle migrate):-
```
truffle compile
```
3. Open Ganache, (to setup local blockchain)
    - crerate new workspace
    - add truffle-config.js  in truffle project 
    - change port to 7545 in server settings (same as port in truffle-config.js)
4. In chrome, open metamask 
   - add new test network using  
        - NETWORK ID (i.e. 5777 ,from Ganache Server settings) 
        - RPC SERVER (i.e HTTP://127.0.0.1:8545 ,from Ganache Server settings)
        - CHAIN CODE (i.e. 1337)
   - import account using private key of any account from local blockchain available in Ganache.
5. In terminal, run following commands:-
- Run migrations to deploy contracts.
```
truffle migrate
```

- To start a server and it will open a homepage (index.html) file in the default browser.
```
npm run dev 
``` 
6. Login to metamask ,and connect the added account to local blockchain (i.e.localhost:3000)
7. Interact with website

### Our technology uses machine learning algorithms to analyze various data points about a product, including its packaging, labeling, and other identifying features.<br>
### This information is compared against our extensive database of legitimate products to determine whether a product is genuine or fake.

## Benefits
### By using our platform, you can protect yourself from the dangers of fake products, including health risks, financial losses, and reputational damage.<br>
### Our technology is fast, accurate, and easy to use, making it an essential tool for anyone who wants to ensure the authenticity of the products they buy or sell.

## Process
### Creating a unique digital ID: Each product is given a unique digital ID, which is stored on the blockchain. This ID contains information about the product, such as its manufacturer, production date, and other identifying features.

### Verification through a decentralized network: To verify the authenticity of a product, the digital ID is checked against the blockchain record using a decentralized network of nodes. This ensures that the record is tamper-proof and cannot be altered by any single entity.

### Secure and transparent tracking: Each time a product is sold or transferred, its blockchain record is updated to reflect the new owner or location. This creates a transparent and secure tracking system that can be accessed by anyone with permission.

### Prevention of counterfeit products: By using blockchain technology, it becomes extremely difficult for counterfeit products to enter the market. Any attempt to create a fake product with a false digital ID would be immediately detected and rejected by the verification network.

## What this website contain!
### Front-end development: The front-end of the website will be responsible for the visual interface that users interact with. It typically involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout, design, and functionality of the website. The front-end will include the hero title, tagline, call to action button, and features section you outlined in your website outline.
<br>


### Back-end development: The back-end of the website is where the fake product recognition system is built. It typically involves programming languages such as Python, PHP, or Java, and will include algorithms and machine learning models to recognize counterfeit products.
<br>


### Database management: A database is a crucial component of any website that stores and organizes data related to the system. For the fake product recognition system, the database will store information on legitimate products, as well as the algorithms and machine learning models used to recognize counterfeit products.
<br>


### Integration: The back-end and front-end will need to be integrated to create a functional website. This involves making sure that the data and functionality of the system are seamlessly connected to the user interface.
<br>


### Testing: Once the website is built, it is important to test it thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning correctly and providing accurate results.
